---WHAT IS A VIRTUAL MACHINE?----

A virtual machine is a software capable of installing an Operating System within itself, making the OS think that it is hosted on a real computer.
With virtual machines we can create virtual devices that will behave in the same way as physical devices, using their own CPU, memory, network interface and storage.
The software program that creates virtual machines is the hypervisor.
The hypervisor is responsible for isolating the VM resources from the system hardware and making the necessary implementations so that the VM can use these resources.
